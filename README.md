Cryptomate is a cryptocurrency app that displays current information about the current market, individual cryptocurrency details, market exchanges, and the most recent related news.

# Overview

I wanted to create a project to practice learning how to create an app with React. It was heavily inspired by the Javascript Mastery's [Cryptoverse project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DDX3US3kss) with lots of changes regarding the tools that were originally used.
